# typical_linear_regression
A Linear Regression Model to predict class 10th Marks based on only one parameter i.e marks of previous classes assuming the stduy behaviour and other factors related to student remains constant.

Used sklearn.linear_models for Linear Regression and Pandas, Numpy for small data manipulation & matplotlib for visual representation.


The model works with error percentage of 1.5% (it's very small because the data itself is very small and also the model is very very simple)
